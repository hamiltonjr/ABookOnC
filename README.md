* What is the project for: the intention here is to solve all the exercises in this book which, in my opinion, it is the best to learn C in all its important details, together with The C Programming Language, written by Brian Kernighan and Denis Ritchie.

• How to test each code: for testing code is just copy each code in Chapter folders and paste on text editor. The user can clone the entire project too from Github. It obviously needed to compile and run each code/program.

• An example of how to use it or get it running: if code is called 1_sea.c, compile it using:

   gcc 01_sea.c

and run ./a.out or compile:

   gcc 01_sea.c -o sea

and run ./sea.

• How to contribute to it: if you want to contribute, you are welcome. But I am solving that exercises too. Thus, maybe any code conflit has to be resolved and merged as my wish.
